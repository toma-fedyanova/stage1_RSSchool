Hello, my name is Tamara, I live in Khabarovsk (Far East of Russia) and I am a police lieutenant colonel, I am an expert and participate in solving economic crimes, who was carried away by the Java script in earnest, and now I want it to become my job.
And now a little about me.
I have a wonderful family and this is my pride :) I really like to spend time with them, more often it is outdoor activities, roller skating, rest in the country, walking around the city. My son shares my passion for drawing, and my daughter and I love to dance.
I have two degrees.
I graduated from the Polytechnic University with a degree in economics and a degree in law, I graduated from an art school and several online courses on stepik, as well as ***.

Why did I get into the Java script, sometimes I ask myself this question .... but I dive into this world of numbers, codes and catch a buzz from this, I want to learn even more and more to dive there with my head, this will be understood only by a person who is passionate about his work .
For me, the best job is doing what you love. And I like it, because doing tasks for writing websites or solving tasks, I lose track of time and the work is done as if by itself.
- Check out my work: this is Project Momentum - a desktop application. In the project, I worked with sound, received information from third-party sites, saved information to local storage, set settings, and also translated the application.
my next project is a minesweeper game. in the settings there is an opportunity to change the size of the playing field
the next project is a virtual keyboard, where it is possible to use a real and virtual keyboard,
further project shelter, contains two pages in which there is a carousel, cards of animals.I worked with layouts in figma, used pixel perfect.
The next project is Plants. on the java script, the functionality was performed when buttons were pressed, i did city cards.
 
I have been studying java script for half a year and became 78 from the list of all those who graduated from stage 0 in RSSChool, which means that I am in the right direction, I study further and work.
And in the end, I set a goal and will soon achieve it ... and this, of course, is an advanced Java script programmer.
